 * CWE: 187 Partial Comparison
 * BadSource: substring Provide a password that is a shortened version of the actual password
 * GoodSource: Provide a matching password
 * Sinks: ncmp_correct_pw
 *    GoodSink: Compare the 2 passwords correctly
 *    BadSink : use strncmp() to do password match, but use the length of the correct password
 * Flow Variant: 15 Control flow: switch(6) and switch(7)
