 * CWE: 123 Write-What-Where Condition
 * BadSource: fgets Overwrite linked list pointers using fgets
 * GoodSource: Don't overwrite linked list pointers
 * Sink:
 *    BadSink : Remove element from list
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one function through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different source files
